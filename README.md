# Scalingo-CLI v1.21.2

[![Codeship Status for Scalingo/cli](https://app.codeship.com/projects/d3ee7f70-ac5f-0137-8f24-1ae29f023aca/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/362207)

This repository contains the command line utility for the public PaaS Scalingo.

Visit our [website](https://scalingo.com).

## How to Build?

The project is using Go, then you need a running Go environment: [Official
documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install)

Once that's done, all you have to do is to `go get` the project, with the
following command:

```
go get github.com/Scalingo/cli/scalingo
```

That's it, you've build the latest version of the Scalingo CLI (the binary will
be present in `$GOPATH/bin/scalingo`)


## How to Upgrade?

```
go get -u github.com/Scalingo/cli/scalingo
```

## Run Behind a Proxy

You have to setup the following environment variables:

```
HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy host>:<proxy port>
HTTPS_PROXY=https://<proxy host>:<proxy port>
```

## Disable Update Checking

By default the CLI is making an HTTP request to learn if a newer version is
available. To disable this feature, define the environment variable:

```
DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECKER=true
```

## Development Setup

In order to build the current development version and use it against the development services:

```bash
cd scalingo
go build .
SCALINGO_API_URL=http://172.17.0.1:3001 SCALINGO_AUTH_URL=http://172.17.0.1:1234 ./scalingo login --api-token <admin user API token>
```

## Release a New Version

Get the latest version of the CLI:

```bash
git switch master
git pull origin master
```

### (optional) Cherry Pick Commits Included in the Release

You may want to cherry pick the commits to include in the release. You first
need to get the commit ID of the previous release (let's call it `base commit
ID`). Then create a new branch and cherry pick all the commits you need, from
the oldest to the most recent. Use the commit ID of the merge of every pull
request you want to include in your release. Don't forget to also cherry pick
the commit for the version bump.

```bash
git checkout <base commit ID>
git checkout -b v1.21.2
git cherry-pick -m 1 <commit ID number 1>
git cherry-pick -m 1 <commit ID number 2>
...
git cherry-pick -m 1 <commit ID number X>
git push --set-upstream origin v1.21.2
```

### New Version Bump

Bump new version number in:

- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `.goxc.json`
- `README.md`
- `VERSION`
- `config/version.go`

And commit these changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Bump version 1.21.2"
git push origin master
```

#### Tag the New Release

```bash
git tag 1.21.2
git push --tags
```

#### Build the New Release

Build the new version for all platforms with:

```sh
./dists/make-release.sh -v 1.21.2 -b
```

Tag and release a new version on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/Scalingo/cli/releases/new). Attach the zip archives
created by the `make-release.sh` script to this release.

Last, restart the Scalingo application `cli-download-service`. It serves as
cache between GitHub and our customers for a more efficient check of what is the
new CLI version. Type:

```
scalingo --region osc-fr1 -a cli-download-service restart
```

You can now update the [changelog](https://doc.scalingo.com/changelog) and tweet about it!
